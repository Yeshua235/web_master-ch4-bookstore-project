Django’s auth app looks for templates within a templates/registration directory, but allauth
prefers they be located within a templates/account directory.

Templates/account was created and then the existing login.html and signup.html
templates were copied into it.

It’s easy to add an "s" onto "account" here by accident, but don’t or you’ll get an error. The correct
directory is templates/account/

the registration directory was then deleted.

The last step is to update the URL links within templates/_base.html to use django-allauth’s URL names rather than Django’s. We do this by adding an "account_" prefix so Django’s "logout" will now be "account_logout", 'login' will be "account_login", and signup will be "account_signup".

Rather than directly log us out, django-allauth has an intermediary “Log Out” page which we can customize to match the rest of our project.

We update the default Log Out template by creating a templates/account/logout.html file to override it.

Even though we are now using an environment variable the actual value of SECRET_KEY is still visible in our source code as it’s merely moved to docker-compose.yml which is tracked by Git. This is true! However, when we configure our website for production, we will create a separate file for production purposes – docker-compose-production.yml – and immediately add it to our .gitignore file so it is not tracked in the source code.
